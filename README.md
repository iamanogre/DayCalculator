DayCalculator
=============
Calculate your age in days! (Not exact to the hours, but definitely the days)

So if the 56732th Monday of your life totally sucked, never worry because the 56733th Monday of your life will be awesome!!

Can also be used to find the number of days between two dates.
Plans: Accepts only days starting at whenever humans began using leap years.

HOW TO USE
=============
I made a GUI now, so to run type in your command-line :  python dayCalcGUI.py
Fill in the pieces and hit submit. Note: I still haven't fixed what happens when days are out of range of the month, but I'll get to it.
